This software ("dominion-pm") is provided for informational and educational
purposes ONLY. Nothing in this software constitutes financial advice, 
investment advice, trading advice, or any other sort of advice.

The analyses, probability estimates, simulations, and any other outputs
generated by this software are based on mathematical models and algorithms
that may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate for your situation.

This software makes NO guarantees about:
  - The accuracy of probability estimates
  - The profitability of any suggested positions
  - The reliability of market data
  - The correctness of expected value calculations
  - Future outcomes of any prediction market

Past performance, simulated results, and backtested strategies do NOT
guarantee future results. Markets are inherently unpredictable.

    console.log(`
Trading prediction markets involves SIGNIFICANT RISK OF LOSS. You can
lose some or ALL of your invested capital. You should:

  - Never invest more than you can afford to lose
  - Understand the mechanics of prediction markets before trading
  - Be aware of fees, slippage, and liquidity constraints
  - Consider the tax implications in your jurisdiction
  - Consult with qualified financial and legal professionals

    console.log(`
By default, this software does NOT execute trades. The "exec" command
only generates intent documents. Any actual trading must be done through
official Polymarket interfaces or APIs with proper account setup.

If any execution capability is added in the future, it will:
  - Be disabled by default
  - Require explicit --approve flag
  - Require interactive confirmation
  - Display clear warnings before any transaction
`);

    console.log('-'.repeat(70));
    console.log(`
The probability estimation models in this software have significant
limitations:

  - LLM-based estimates may reflect training data biases
  - Baseline heuristics are simplistic and may not capture market dynamics
  - Models cannot predict black swan events
  - Confidence intervals may be poorly calibrated
  - Edge calculations assume market efficiency that may not hold
`);

    console.log(chalk.bold.yellow('6. DATA ACCURACY'));
    console.log('-'.repeat(70));
    console.log(`
Market data is fetched from third-party APIs and may be:
  - Delayed or stale
  - Incorrect or incomplete
  - Subject to rate limiting or unavailability
  
Always verify data from official sources before making decisions.
`);

    console.log(chalk.bold.yellow('7. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE'));
    console.log('-'.repeat(70));
    console.log(`
Prediction markets may be regulated or prohibited in your jurisdiction.
It is YOUR responsibility to:

  - Understand applicable laws and regulations
  - Ensure you are legally permitted to participate
  - Report any gains or losses for tax purposes
  - Comply with all applicable financial regulations
